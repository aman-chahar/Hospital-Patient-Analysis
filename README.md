üè• Hospital Patient Analysis: Unveiling Insights from Healthcare Data

In my recent analysis project, I delved into hospital patient data to uncover valuable insights that can significantly impact healthcare decision-making and patient outcomes. Leveraging data from three CSV files‚Äîdrug_code.csv, diagnostic_code.csv, and patient_data.csv‚ÄîI conducted a comprehensive analysis encompassing patient demographics, drug prescriptions, diagnoses, and mortality rates. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into the key findings and methodologies:

1. Identifying High-Risk Patients
I pinpointed patients prescribed drugs with high severity levels and a high mortality rate, crucial for targeted intervention and care prioritization.

2. Gender Distribution among Expired Patients
Analyzing the gender distribution among expired patients provided insights into potential gender-specific healthcare needs and outcomes.

3. Common Diagnoses for High-Risk Patients
Determining the most common diagnosis codes among high-risk patients shed light on prevalent health issues within this vulnerable group.

4. Mortality Rate by Diagnosis Type
By calculating mortality rates for each diagnosis type, I uncovered critical insights into disease severity and patient prognosis.

5. Drug Prescription Trends
Identifying the top prescribed drugs across all patients highlighted prevalent medication practices, aiding in resource allocation and treatment optimization.

6. Gender Disparity in Critical Diagnoses
Analyzing gender distribution among patients with critical diagnoses revealed potential gender-based disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.

The analysis was enriched with visualizations including pie charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts to facilitate clear understanding and interpretation of the findings.

This project underscores the importance of data-driven insights in healthcare decision-making, resource allocation, and patient care strategies. By harnessing the power of data analytics, we can drive positive change and improve healthcare outcomes for all.
